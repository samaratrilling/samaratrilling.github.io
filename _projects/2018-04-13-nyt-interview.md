Kevin Roose from The New York Times interviewed me for a special print-only Kids section in April 2018 (complete with comic!) about what it's like to be a programmer.

While it rather overstated the number of dinosaurs and dragons I worth with, not to mention the number of fish on my desk, I take solace in the fact that I did my part to prepare the next generation for weird tech jargon like pairing, retros, LGTMs and ML.
