For Eric Foner's 2015 *Columbia and Slavery* seminar, I wrote about Columbia's enigmatic first history professor, Francis Lieber. The paper was published as part of the [Columbia University and Slavery](https://columbiaandslavery.columbia.edu/content/tale-two-columbias-francis-lieber-columbia-university-and-slavery) project.

It was the last paper I wrote in college, the longest, and the most interesting â€“ though if readers disagree with this last point, no need to disabuse me of this belief.

In keeping with my penchant for maps, I also made a [map](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GHVYtm4MuZfWLzBbVXP7t911w2Q) of the most significant locales in Francis Lieber's New York.
